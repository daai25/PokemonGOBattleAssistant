# Project Charta
## Problem Definition
New players coming to Pokemon Go are going to struggle with the highly complex combat system. There is much to consider such as type weaknesses, charged moves, fast moves, pokemon stats, and more. 
Another problem that new players will have is identifying the mant different pokemon and learning what their names are. Given there is over 800 pokemon in pokemon go it'll be no easy task. 

## Situation Assessment HAVE NOT DONE.
Describe the available resources (personnel, material, (software) tools, infrastructure, etc.) and time as well as restrictions and constraints. Possible risks that may arise during the project are also identified.

## Project Goals and Success Criteria
For our battle assistant to be successful it needs to boost the winrate for new players overall while utilizing multiple aspects for pokemon fights.

For our image recognition to be successful it should be able to recognize a pokemon and output the correct name with a high accuracy rate.

## Data Mining Goals HAVE NOT DONE. WRITTEN WHEN MODEL IS DONE
Map the problem definition, datasets to be used and primary objective onto a data mining task, e.g.:

* Classification
* Regression
* Clustering
* Outlier Detection
* Association rule learning (market basket analysis)
* Recommender System
* Visualisation
* ...

Along with the definition of the actual technical problem (category) to be solved, 
the project goals must be mapped onto quitable quantitative metrics and corresponding target values. For example, for a classification task one might specify an *F-score* of 0.9 as a minimal requirement for an acceptable solution.  
Such a requirement should be aligned with the overall project goals and/or literature references or justified by other references, respectively.


## Project Plan
Divide the project into individual phases, describe them briefly and draw up a preliminary timetable, e.g. as a Gantt chart:
