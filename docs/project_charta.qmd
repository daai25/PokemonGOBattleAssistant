# Project Charta
## Problem Definition
New players coming to Pokemon Go are going to struggle with the highly complex combat system. There is much to consider such as type weaknesses, charged moves, fast moves, pokemon stats, and more. 

Another problem that new players will have is identifying the mant different pokemon and learning what their names are. Given there is over 800 pokemon in pokemon go it'll be no easy task. 

## Situation Assessment

We are developing a **Pokémon battle assistant** that recommends the best Pokemon choices for players during battles. Additionally, we are creating an **image recognition model** that identifies Pokémon based on images and outputs their names.

We will use Python libraries such as `pandas`, `selenium`, and `csv` for data processing and automation. Our data source and battle simulations will rely entirely on [pvpoke.com](https://pvpoke.com). ChatGPT will assist us with coding and other support tasks.

### Constraints

- The project must be completed within **4 weeks**, requiring careful planning and time management.
- The team size is limited to four members
- Complete dependency on pvpoke.com for battle data and simulations; potential risk if the site changes or becomes unavailable.
- The image recognition model’s accuracy depends on the quality and quantity of training data.

### Risks

- Potential changes in pvpoke.com’s site structure or access policies could disrupt data gathering and simulations.
- Insufficient training data or poor labeling could reduce image recognition model performance.
- Integration challenges between the battle assistant and the image recognition model or difficulties with Python libraries.
- The tight 4-week timeline may limit thorough testing, optimization, and documentation.
- Risk of scope creep if project goals are not clearly defined and managed.



## Project Goals and Success Criteria
For our battle assistant to be successful it needs to boost the winrate for new players overall while utilizing multiple aspects for pokemon fights.

For our image recognition to be successful it should be able to recognize a pokemon and output the correct name with a high accuracy rate.

## Data Mining Goals HAVE NOT DONE. WRITTEN WHEN MODEL IS DONE
Map the problem definition, datasets to be used and primary objective onto a data mining task, e.g.:

* Classification
* Regression
* Clustering
* Outlier Detection
* Association rule learning (market basket analysis)
* Recommender System
* Visualisation
* ...

Along with the definition of the actual technical problem (category) to be solved, 
the project goals must be mapped onto quitable quantitative metrics and corresponding target values. For example, for a classification task one might specify an *F-score* of 0.9 as a minimal requirement for an acceptable solution.  
Such a requirement should be aligned with the overall project goals and/or literature references or justified by other references, respectively.


## Project Plan
Divide the project into individual phases, describe them briefly and draw up a preliminary timetable, e.g. as a Gantt chart:
