# Evaluation

### Do results meet user needs?
Yes – the battle prediction model and image classifier satisfy the requirements for the Pokémon GO Battle Assistant.

### Continue the project?
No – we will not proceed with further development at this time.

### Planning of the deployment
- Package the CatBoost battle predictor and the CNN image classifier as REST endpoints.  
- Integrate into the existing web/mobile application for real‐time use.

### Additional data mining iteration (if we were to continue)
- Expand the image dataset with more Pokémon from Pokémon GO to improve classification coverage.  
- Introduce further feature engineering on battle data to increase accuracy above 0.79.

### Enhance the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model with:
  - More extensive fine-tuning of deeper layers
  - More sophisticated data augmentation techniques
  - Implement support for missing Pokémon species to increase coverage

### Governance and ethical considerations
No governance issues or ethical concerns were encountered.
