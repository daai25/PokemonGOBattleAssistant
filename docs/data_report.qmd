# Data Report
All information on the data used in the Pokémon GO Battle Assistant project is compiled in this data report to ensure traceability and reproducibility of the results and to enable systematic expansion of the database.

The project utilizes three main data sources: Pokémon statistics and moves from the [PvPoke rankings site](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/), battle simulation data from the [PvPoke battles site](https://pvpoke.com/battle/), and image datasets collected through the Python library `duckduckgo_search`. These raw datasets undergo preprocessing and feature engineering to create processed datasets suitable for machine learning model development.
